Lumina - Pomodoro Website
Lumina is a simple and elegant Pomodoro website designed to help you manage your time effectively and boost productivity. The website provides a user-friendly interface for implementing the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Features
Timer Controls: Start, pause, and reset the timer with a click of a button.
Task List: Keep track of your tasks and enhance your focus during work intervals.
Pomodoro Counter: Track the number of Pomodoros completed in a session.
Settings: Customize the timer durations, theme, and timer sounds.
